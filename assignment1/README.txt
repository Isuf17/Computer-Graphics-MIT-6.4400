1. I used macos to compile and run, and used VScode.
2. I collaborated with Lucian, Bryson and Alice (sorry don't know last names!)
    Me and Lucian talked through the structure of CurveNode together, Bryson helped debug CurveNode,
    and Alice really helped me with PatchNode, and understanding how to plot.
3. No, I tried looking for GLOO docs but couldn't find any.
4. I don't think there are any known problems! I did Init weirdly, because I didn't
    fully get how we broke everything up.
5. No, assignment was way harder than expected!
6. I think this was p tough, but I also started a little late. I'm not 
    too sure if I do fully understand PatchNode.
