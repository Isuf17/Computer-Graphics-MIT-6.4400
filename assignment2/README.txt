1. Compiled code on macos.
2. I went to OH and Amy Ni guided me through connecting bones to joints.
3. No references used.
4. No known problems (can't seem to work out grey in rgb though).
5. Computed per vertex normals.
6. I think perhaps more guidance on computing the new normals, and loading the weights and mesh file properly.
