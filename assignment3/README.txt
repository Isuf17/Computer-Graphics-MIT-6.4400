1. Used macos
2. I went to some OH to debug an issue I had with using too many autos, but otherwise I mostly completed the assignment on my own.
3. Did not use anything extra.
4. No problems with my code! However, my values for the spring constants and stuff might be really whacky, but it was the best I could make.
5. I did no extra credit, however, I thought it would look better if we could see the diagonal springs as well, so I showed them all in the cloth.
6. I think if there was a little more guidance on how to use the template classes, that would have been helpful. Also, I think it would have been much easier to visualise
    the cloth if we were given one to put onto what I rendered.
