1. macos
2. I collaborated with Lucian on just talking through some concepts, and same with Alice.
3. I used the following link to help with PCF: https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping
4. No known problems.
5. I implemented the PCF, but that is it.
6. This assignment felt way less algorithmic, and was way more frustrating
    than the others, even though it seemed to require less code. I think 
    having to use all these APIs and glsl when coding in GLOO is still new
    was very difficult.
